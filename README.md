# haskell-advent-of-code
My solutions to the [adventofcode.com](http://adventofcode.com/) puzzles, done in Haskell.

Many thanks to [@nedbat](https://github.com/nedbat) for his [blog post](http://nedbatchelder.com/blog/201512/advent_of_code.html) 
that originally turned me on to the site and [@topaz](https://github.com/topaz) for making it.
